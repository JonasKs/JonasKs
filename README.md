# Hi [üêç](https://snok.dev)
This profile contains my personal projects, such as chat bots, chat servers, scripts, example code and so on.  
For published PyPi packages see [github.com/snok](https://github.com/snok).

Author of [`Django-GUID` (156‚≠ê)](https://github.com/snok/django-guid), which I've rewritten completely to support `ASGI`/`async` for `Django>=3.1`. Django GUID injects a correlation ID into every log message from a Django request, making troubleshooting easy. It integrates with Celery and Sentry.

I am the maintainer of [`Django-auth-ADFS` (119‚≠ê)](https://github.com/snok/django-auth-adfs), a library to implement Azure AD and ADFS for Django and Django Rest Framework.

You can reach me on `jonas-ks@hotmail.com`.
