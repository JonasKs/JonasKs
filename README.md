# Hi [üêç](https://snok.dev)
This profile contains my personal projects, such as chat bots, chat servers, scripts, example code and so on.  
For published PyPi packages see [@snok](https://github.com/snok) and [@intility](https://github.com/intility).

* Author of both sync and async versions of [`Django-GUID`](https://github.com/snok/django-guid). Django GUID injects a correlation ID into every log message from a Django request, making troubleshooting easy. It integrates with Celery and Sentry. [Used by](https://github.com/snok/django-guid/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS03NjU4NDA3NzQ%3D) awesome projects such as [`ansible/AWX`](https://github.com/ansible/awx), [`ansible/galaxy_ng`](https://github.com/ansible/galaxy_ng) and [`pulp/pulpcore`](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore) 

* Author of [`FastAPI-Azure-auth`](https://github.com/intility/fastapi-azure-auth). A package to implement Azure AD authentication and authorization in FastAPI applications. 

* Author of [`Metroid`](https://github.com/intility/metroid). Metroid is an async framework for subscribing to Azure ServiceBus messages and acting on them with Celery. API to publish messages included. 

* Maintainer of [`Django-auth-ADFS`](https://github.com/snok/django-auth-adfs), a library to implement Azure AD and ADFS authentication for Django and Django Rest Framework.

Currently working on a FastAPI app to upload, view and manage my S3 bucket.
