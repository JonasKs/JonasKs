# Hi [🐍](https://snok.dev)
This profile contains my personal projects, such as chat bots, chat servers, scripts, example code and so on.  
For published PyPi packages see [github.com/snok](https://github.com/snok).

I’ve just finished rewriting [Django-GUID](https://github.com/snok/django-guid) to support ASGI and asyncio support for `Django>=3.1`.

I'm working on a new Django middleware for `Django>=3.1`, and hope to write some FastAPI's in the close future.

You can reach me on `jonas-ks@hotmail.com`.  
My personal notebook can be found [here](https://hotfix.guru).

If we've collaborated, feel free to add me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jonasks).
