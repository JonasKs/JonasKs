# Hi [🐍](https://snok.dev)
The projects you find on my personal profile are small projects such as chat bots, chat servers, scripts, example code and so on.  
For bigger projects or published PyPi packages see [@snok](https://github.com/snok) and [@intility](https://github.com/intility).

I'm the author of:

* 🔒 [`FastAPI-Azure-auth`](https://github.com/intility/fastapi-azure-auth) - Implement Azure AD authentication and authorization in FastAPI applications with ease. Single- and multi-tenant support. 

* 📝 [`Django-GUID`](https://github.com/snok/django-guid) - Inject a correlation ID into every log message from a Django request, making troubleshooting easy. Integrates with Celery and Sentry. [Used by](https://github.com/snok/django-guid/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS03NjU4NDA3NzQ%3D) awesome projects such as [`ansible/AWX`](https://github.com/ansible/awx). 

* 🚂 [`Metroid`](https://github.com/intility/metroid) - Metroid is an async Django-framework for subscribing to Azure ServiceBus messages and acting on them with Celery. API to publish messages included. 

* 🔒 [`Django-auth-ADFS`](https://github.com/snok/django-auth-adfs) - Implement Azure AD and ADFS authentication for Django and Django Rest Framework. Originally authored by Jobec, but [@snok](https://github.com/snok) has taken ownership and authored a bunch of new features over the last year or so.

... but also involved in and maintain a bunch of other projects 🚀 See pins/feed/organizations. 

I'm currently working on:
* 🔒 Version `3` of [`FastAPI-Azure-auth`](https://github.com/intility/fastapi-azure-auth). A big project to support `v2` tokens and **multi-tenant** applications.
* 🛠️ Create-FastAPI-app for Intility projects. Will be a subfolder under [intility/templates](https://github.com/intility/templates)
